# pattern-matching-algorithms
In this project we will, implement, test and compare three pattern matching algorithms. Brute-Force(Naïve), Boyer-Moore-Horspool and Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithms. 

README

This project is implemented by TJ Bah and Ria Banerjee as part of Algorithms and Data Structures class.

This project 3 implements following three algorithms for pattern searching:

1.	Brute Force (Naive) Algorithm
2.	Boyer-Moore Horspool Algorithm
3.	Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm

Throughout the three algorithms, we are using standard common test cases, as mentioned below:

// TEST Case 1
String T = "THIS IS A SIMPLE EXAMPLE";
String P = "SIMPLE";

// Test Case 2
String T = "AAAAAAAAAAH";
String P = "AAAAH";

// TEST Case 3
String T = "THIS IS MY NEW STRING AAAAHHHH";
String P = "NEW";

// TEST Case 4
String T = "THIS TEST WILL HAVE MULTIPLE MATCHES, SO THAT WE CAN TEST. ONE MORE TEST.";
String P = "TEST";

// TEST Case 5
String T = "COMPUTER SCIENCE IS NO MORE ABOUT COMPUTERS THAN ASTRONOMY IS ABOUT TELESCOPES";
String P = "NO";

// TEST Case 6
String T = "NO COMPUTER IS EVER GOING TO ASK A NEW, REASONABLE QUESTION. IT TAKES TRAINED PEOPLE TO DO THAT.";
String P = "TRAINED";

// TEST Case 7
String T = "WE CAN ONLY SEE A SHORT DISTANCE AHEAD, BUT WE CAN SEE PLENTY THERE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.";
String P = "DISTANCE";

 // TEST Case 8
String T = "QAZQAZQAZQAZZQAZZQAZZQAZZZZZZZZQQQQQQQZZZZZQAQAQAQAQAZZZQAAAAAZZZQAZZZZZZZQQQQQAAAZZZ";
String P = "QAZZZ";

// TEST Case 9
String T = "COMPUTER SCIENCE IS THE OPERATING SYSTEM FOR ALL INNOVATION.";
String P = "NOVA";

 // TEST Case 10
String T = "WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWKWWWWWKWWWWK";
String P = "WWWK";

The goal is to find the number of comparisons taken by each algorithm for each test case.

Brute Force (Naive) Algorithm

This code is written in Java, so you would require java environment to run the code on the local machine. Java version 8 and above is recommended. And a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ etc.) to run the code. The implementation of this algorithm is provided in the zip file ‘project_3_Naive_Algo.zip’. The test cases are commented out. Please un-comment the test cases you want to run.

Boyer-Moore Horspool Algorithm

This code is written in Java, so you would require java environment to run the code on the local machine. Java version 8 and above is recommended. And a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ etc.) to run the code. The implementation of this algorithm is provided in the zip file ‘project_3_BM_Horspool_Algo.zip’. The test cases are commented out. Please un-comment the test cases you want to run.

Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm

This code is written in Python. It is hosted on Google Colab. Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_d04gjSJLokszAEj2NODVgpzjVikZZg7.
At the end of the file, there are two variables txt (text) and pat (pattern). You can change the text you want to check for, and the pattern that you want to search in the text. This can be done in the code. Then just run the cell. It outputs the indexes where the pattern was found in the original string, and the comparisons made.
